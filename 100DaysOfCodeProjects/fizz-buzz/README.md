# Fizz Buzz

Write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of FizzBuzz game:

- Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.

- When the number is divisible by 3 then, instead of printing the number, it should print "Fizz".

- When the number is divisible by 5 then, instead of printing the number, it should print "Buzz".

- When the number is divisible by 3 and 5 then, instead of printing the number, it should print "FizzBuzz".

e.g. It might start off like this:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz

Improvements(?)
- 0 is being "FizzBuzzed".

- Reduce conditional statements in main.go? Make more efficient?

- Requires fmt.Printf to utilize \n. Different way to get a newline?

Learning Point: Switch statements can be used instead of conditional statements. Still learning when one is better than the other in what circumstances.
