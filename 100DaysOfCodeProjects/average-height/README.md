# Average Height

Write a program that calculates the averages student height from a list of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights.

1146 / 7 = 163.71428571428672

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164.

Important: The sum() or len() functions should not be used in the answer. Replace their functionality using for loops.


Learning Points: Error handling is still confusing. Getting better at grasping the "red, green, refactor" cycle. Developing the test first seemed smoother.

If a function intakes a type, it must return that type, or receive this error: (variable of type int) as float64 value. While researching the error, it appears this error may be able to be avoided with the use of generics. Generics are still an unknown at this time.
