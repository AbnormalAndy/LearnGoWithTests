# High Score

Write a program that calculates the highest score from a list of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important: Not allowed to use MAX or MIN functions. The output words must match the example.

I.E. The highest score in the class is: X.

## Example Input

78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89

In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

## Example Output

The highest score in the class is: 91.
