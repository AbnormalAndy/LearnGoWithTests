Tip Calculator

Instructions:

- If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

- Each person should pay (150/5) * 1.12 = 33.6.

- Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60.

- Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

Learning Points: Scan(), Scanln(), and Scanf() do not take float inputs. Bufio package was utilized to take inputs requiring a decimal point.

Types need to match for function parameters if a calculation between the two parameters takes place in the function. I wonder if a type conversion can be done in the function calculation to still take different type parameters.

Possible To-Dos:
- Refactor to make more functional?
- Cleaner way to collect user input?
- Write test for TipCalculator function?
