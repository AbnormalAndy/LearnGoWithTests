# Heads or Tails

Write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalized and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. "Heads", NOT "heads".

- Generate a random number, either 0 or 1.

- Use that number to print out "Heads" or "Tails".

e.g. 1 means Heads; 0 means Tails.
